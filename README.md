# Fortify: Exploring Layouts

Hey there! Welcome to the Fortify: Exploring Layouts assignment! This is where I'll be diving into the fascinating world of web layouts, getting hands-on experience with different layout patterns, and sharpening my skills along the way.

## What's Inside?

This repository is neatly organized into three parts, each offering its own set of challenges and learning opportunities:

### 0. Guided Tutorial

In this section, I'll be replicating the "Holy Grail" layout multiple times. It's all about getting comfortable with CSS Grid and mastering the art of layout creation.

### 1. Challenge

Here, I'll be tasked with recreating various grid layouts. It's time to put my skills to the test and replicate several grid layout designs provided in this section.

### 2. Submission Work

This is where the real fun begins! My objective is to recreate a landing page from an image using the provided styles and assets. I'll focus on accurately reflecting the design and layout, bringing it to life on the web.

## Helpful Resources

To guide me along this journey, I'll have access to some handy resources:

- [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)
- [Best Grid Layout Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kVeCqQCxlk)
- Practical Guide (I'll add any relevant links or tutorials that I find helpful)
